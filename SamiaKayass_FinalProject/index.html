      <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
      <article>
          I got my associate degree in Business Administration in 2015, I worked for 3 years in a construction company, in these 3 years I was working in different department, I started as a Human Resource agent then IT Manager and the last year I worked as an Administrative Assistance. I am a person who loves to discover everything and help with everything. Working in IT department was my best experience, I learned a lot of things. That was one of the reasons why I did a college degree in computer programming, I am in my second year at GTCC, and I am enjoying it. Today I am up to date on all computer programming languages and terms and my data entry skills are fast and efficient. I am incredibly organized and very detail oriented; I rarely make errors and know what even a small mistake can mean to a project.<br><br>
          
          <br>
          
          <p><b>HTML:</b> I learned basic html in my previous course and I learned a lot in this course, especially how to link an HTML document to an external style sheet and how to insert a symbol from a set of characters &#8226; &#162; &#8226; </p>
          
          <p><b>CSS:</b> I learned the basics of CSS in the previous course and learned a lot in this course, especially how to work with margins and padding. Also working with pseudo classes, which was an interesting chapter for me.</p>
          
          <p><b>JAVASCRIPT:</b> It was my first time learning JAVASCRIPT, I think it's easier than JAVA and PHP, I really like it and enjoyed learning it. I chose to add a button on my page when you click on it my name will appear.</p>
